# Deliveroo Clone Project

## Functional Components
I analysed the Deliveroo homepage and identified its major sections. These sections were then broken down into separate functional components in React:

- **Hero Section**: Contains Hero Image with overlaying text and search bar.
- **Carousel Images**: Displays various images of cuisines.
- **Offer Image**: Contains a section with an image displaying an offer
- **Get Started Cards**: Displays cards with images, text and buttons
- **Footer**: Displays a 4 coloum footer

## Styling the Website
I created custom CSS rules to ensure that the website looks visually similar to the original Deliveroo homepage. Some of the key styling features include:
- **Responsive layout** using CSS Grid and Flexbox to arrange the restaurant listings.
- **Fixed header** that stays at the top of the page as the user scrolls.
- **Image-based banners** and restaurant logos to create a similar aesthetic.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Used for building the user interface with functional components.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and creating the responsive design.
- **React Router**: For setting up any future routes (optional).
