# Deliveroo Clone Project

## Functional Components
I analyzed the Deliveroo homepage and identified its major sections. These sections were then broken down into separate functional components in React:

- **Header**: Contains the Deliveroo logo, search bar, and user navigation links.
- **Restaurant Listings**: Displays various restaurants available on Deliveroo, with an image and description.
- **Footer**: Contains useful links about Deliveroo, terms and conditions, etc.

## Passing Props Between Components
To demonstrate the use of props, I passed data such as restaurant information (e.g., restaurant name, image, and description) from the **Restaurant List** component to the **Restaurant Item** component.

## Styling the Website
I created custom CSS rules to ensure that the website looks visually similar to the original Deliveroo homepage. Some of the key styling features include:
- **Responsive layout** using CSS Grid and Flexbox to arrange the restaurant listings.
- **Fixed header** that stays at the top of the page as the user scrolls.
- **Image-based banners** and restaurant logos to create a similar aesthetic.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Used for building the user interface with functional components.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and creating the responsive design.
- **React Router**: For setting up any future routes (optional).
